# Gerenciador de Repositórios do GitHub

Este projeto é uma aplicação web simples desenvolvida em React que permite aos usuários buscar e gerenciar repositórios do GitHub. Com ele, é possível adicionar repositórios à lista local e removê-los conforme necessário.

## Funcionalidades

- **Busca de Repositórios:** Permite buscar repositórios no GitHub usando o nome do repositório.
- **Adicionar Repositórios:** Adiciona os repositórios encontrados à lista local, evitando duplicações.
- **Remover Repositórios:** Remove repositórios da lista local com um simples clique.
- **Visualizar Detalhes:** Exibe informações básicas sobre cada repositório, como nome e descrição, e um link para o repositório no GitHub.

## Tecnologias Utilizadas

- **React:** Biblioteca JavaScript para construção da interface de usuário.
- **Axios:** Cliente HTTP para realizar requisições à API do GitHub.
- **Styled Components:** Biblioteca para estilização de componentes em React.
- **API do GitHub:** Utilizada para buscar informações sobre os repositórios.

## Como Usar

1. **Clone o repositório:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/seu-usuario/nome-do-repositorio.git
   cd nome-do-repositorio

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
